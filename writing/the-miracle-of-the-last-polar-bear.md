# The Miracle of the Last Polar Bear

The last polar bear neither ate nor drank. He just wandered the world. His hair shone bright white and his body grew bigger
every year. When he arrived in Budapest, crowds of curious people filled the streets. We had never seen an animal this
big. Standing on all fours, it was taller than the Gellért Hotel. He carefully crawled to the top of Gellért
Hill without knocking anything down or stepping on anyone. He sat nicely next to the Citadel and waited for the people.

The last polar bear did not speak with words, but answered every question. Children asked what his favorite ice cream
was. Grandmothers asked if it wasn't very cold at the North Pole. And the mayors who made the pilgrimage to the capital
asked how they could save the planet.

The mayors did not like his first answer. But they kept asking the last polar bear until they got a solution to their
liking. Then they all went home and implemented the solutions of the last polar bear. Today we celebrate these
solutions and express our gratitude to the last polar bear and to the resourceful mayors.

A horse-based ride sharing system was introduced in Debrecen and Nyíregyháza. When not in use, the horses
automatically return to their stations and recharge themselves.

In Salgótarján, researchers have created a special species of moss. They introduced it in the old mine which now
yields green coal. This green energy source is popular throughout the region.

In the vicinity of Szekszárd, the previous mayor has shut down the nuclear power plant that fed on devilish
forces. But thanks to the advice of the last polar bear, they found a renewable alternative resource. From time to time,
they float plans to restart the power plant and harness the energy of protest marches.

The energy supply of Zalaegerszeg and Kaposvár was solved by using the biogas produced during the decomposition of
the eels that die off in Lake Balaton.

In Eger, the wine producers built a wine refining plant. Travelers in the area can fill their vehicles with red or white
fuel according to their preference.

A seismic power plant was built in Tatabánya. This puts the destructive energies of potential earthquakes at the service
of the Hungarian people.

In Békéscsaba, the capital of Viharsarok, the raging power of lightning has been tamed. Wherever it hits, it ends up in our
outlets!

The solution in Veszprém was to revive ancient Hungarian traditions. In a power plant built by the local
táltos, pendulums placed at the junctions of ley lines drive the generators.

At the Department of Sociology of the University of Pécs, a new theory was developed about the tension between the owning
class and the working class. This tension is converted into electrical voltage via a piezoelectric transformer.

Researchers at the University of Szeged studied the gravitational waves emitted when black holes collide with neutron
stars. Their uncannily sensitive instruments can convert the cosmic energies released in distant
galaxies into electric current.

A complex optical system was built in Székesfehérvár, which focuses the shining light of Hungarian history onto a water
tank. It drives a steam turbine.

In Szolnok a voltage difference was measured between the horns of the Racka sheep. Today, the
electrodes mounted on the flock supply the entire city with electricity. Electrical installation of the Hungarian Gray
cattle is also underway.

In Szombathely and Sopron, traffic flowing across the Austrian-Hungarian border was dammed up. The dam powers
environmentally friendly generators.

The residents of Kecskemét have long known the power of hot peppers. But it was only thanks to the last polar bear that
they learned how to use this power in the energy industry.

Scientists from Miskolc followed 20th century designs and successfully cloned Süsü, the one-headed dragon.
Residential heating is now provided by Süsü's breath.

In Budapest, a breakthrough solution was found for turning gasoline into a renewable fuel. The legal solution
is based on the fact that crude oil is formed from dead creatures. Creatures, of course, will keep dying.
